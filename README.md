It's a 3D data visualization project that visualizes the academic achievements and interdisciplinary collaboration of faculty in university. This is a project with a separated front-end and back-end architecture. The front end is built using Three.js and the React framework, while the back end uses MySQL as the database, Redis for caching, and Flask for developing APIs. This is a practical, real-world project that has been deployed on large screens on the Tongji University campus.
